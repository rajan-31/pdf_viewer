__It works with the help of https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js__

Purpose:

In most of the mobile browsers there is no way to directly view pdf file without downloading it, this tool helps you with that problem.

When to use:

- You hate downloading pdf files just to take a look at it.
- You don't want to risk your safety by dowloading and opening PDF file locally (use in browser incognito mode for addditional safety).
